## About

[Connections Result Fixer](https://scheiber.github.io/connections-results-fixer/)
allows you to copy your results from [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) and have two spaces automatically added to the end of each line, making the lines appear "stacked" when sharing on platforms that use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYTConnections/).

To use this tool, copy your results from Connections as you normally would, paste them into the box, and click "Fix It!"

The fixed results will be automatically copied to your clipboard, ready to share.
